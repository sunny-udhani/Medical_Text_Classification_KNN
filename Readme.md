# Text Classification

Medical abstracts describe the current conditions of a patient. Doctors routinely scan dozens or hundreds of abstracts each day as they do their rounds in a hospital and must quickly pick up on the salient information pointing to the patientâ€™s malady. 

Design an assistive technology that can identify, with high precision, the class of problems described in the abstract. In the given dataset, abstracts from 5 different conditions have been included: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions. 

> Develop predictive models that can determine, given a particular medical abstract,which one of 5 classes it belongs to.

The training dataset consists of 14438 records and the test dataset consists of 14442 records.

### Objectives

- Choose appropriate techniques for modeling text.
- Implement the k-nearest neighbor classifier (cannot use libraries for this algorithm).
- Use your version of the k-NN classifier to assign classes to medical texts.
- Think about dealing with imbalanced data.
- Evaluate results using the F1 Scoring Metric.

#### Preprocessing - Stemmer fix, Lemmatization, TF-IDF Vectorizer for bag of words with n-grams

#### Unbalanced data - SMOTE over-sampling

### F1-Score = 0.7758
